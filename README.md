# Admin-Controlled-VISA-Chatbot

Virtual International Student Assistant bot developed using IBM Watson Assistant. Changes can be made to the bot using the chat itself. Admin can take over and access the admin view just by typing the secret key in the chatbox.</br>
It's a first kind of novel approach to make changes in the bot. The bot can be taught, trained through the chat. No need to add intents, entities manually using the interface.
